# ft_printf (The new cursus)
this is a 42Network school project, aim to replicate the printf behaviour from the standard library of c and undertand it.
The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for
us. This project is of moderate difficulty. It will enable you to discover variadic functions
in C.
The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code.
